# Housing-Prices-Linear-Regression
### Objective
The task is to build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on 13 different features,<br> such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, stories, mainroad, <br> guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishingstatus

### Dataset Description
Dataset: Housing-1.csv
The dataset includes 13 features used to predict house prices. These features are: <br>
Feature	Description <br>
price	Target variable: house price in dollars <br>
**area**:	Area of the house (square feet) <br>
**bedrooms:**	Number of bedrooms <br>
**bathrooms:**	Number of bathrooms <br>
**stories:**	Number of stories <br>
**mainroad:**	Whether the house is on a main road <br>
**guestroom:**	Whether the house has a guestroom <br>
**basement:**	Whether the house has a basement <br>
**hotwaterheating:**	Whether the house has hot water heating <br>
**airconditioning:**	Whether the house has air conditioning <br>
**parking:**	Number of parking spaces <br>
**prefarea:**	Whether the house is in a preferred area <br>
**furnishingstatus:**	Furnishing status of the house
